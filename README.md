B9Lab-ETH17-Remittance
======================

This is the Solidity-only solution to the Remittance problem presented at https://academy.b9lab.com/courses/course-v1:B9lab+ETH-17+2017-10/courseware/82c7df09b67c4f96818e0a32a59b6457/d5b4341029a249bdb438d5a87a9c5a94/ . The code currently includes none of the "stretch goals".

You can use a Solidity-equivalent `keccak256` function in Truffle's console by using `web3.sha3`, or the [solidity-sha3 library](https://github.com/raineorshine/solidity-sha3), that claims to be more reliable.
