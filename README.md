B9Lab-ETH17-Remittance
======================

This is the Solidity-only solution to the Remittance problem presented at https://academy.b9lab.com/courses/course-v1:B9lab+ETH-17+2017-10/courseware/82c7df09b67c4f96818e0a32a59b6457/d5b4341029a249bdb438d5a87a9c5a94/ . The code currently includes none of the "stretch goals".

Note, if I need to use Keccak256 in JavaScript - e.g. in Truffle's console - there is a solution here https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/3567/2224 .
